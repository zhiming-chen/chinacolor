\title{Create a color_pick List for ctc_palette Function}
\usage{
create_color_pick(
  color_id = NULL,
  groups = NULL,
  subgroups = NULL,
  order_rule = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{color_id}{A vector of specific color IDs to include (directly selected from \code{chinacolor}).}

\item{groups}{A vector of group numbers to filter colors from (based on \code{chinacolor$group_id}).}

\item{subgroups}{A list where each element corresponds to subgroups (1-4 or -1) for the respective group in \code{groups}.
Use \code{-1} to reverse the order of subgroups (equivalent to \code{4:1}). If \code{NULL}, defaults to all subgroups (1:4) for each group.}

\item{order_rule}{Sorting rule for the selected colors:
\code{1} (preserve input order), \code{0} (sort by color ID ascending), or \code{-1} (sort by color ID descending). Defaults to \code{1}.}
}
\value{
A properly structured \code{color_pick} list compatible with \code{ctc_palette(type = "custom")}.
}
\description{
This function helps users easily create a properly formatted \code{color_pick} list
required by the \code{ctc_palette()} function, specifically for selecting colors from the \code{chinacolor} dataset.
}
\details{
All color selections are derived from the \code{chinacolor} dataset, which contains colors categorized by \code{group}, \code{subgroup}, and \code{color_id}.
\itemize{
\item If \code{groups} are specified, colors are first filtered by group and subgroup.
\item \code{color_id} allows direct inclusion of specific colors, which are appended to the group/subgroup selections.
\item Duplicate colors (from overlapping group/subgroup and \code{color_id} selections) are automatically removed while preserving order.
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Example 1: Select colors by specific IDs
color_pick <- create_color_pick(color_id = c(4, 8, 12))

# Example 2: Select colors by groups and subgroups
color_pick <- create_color_pick(
  groups = c(35, 27),
  subgroups = list(c(2, 4), c(1, 3))  # Subgroups for group 35 and 27 respectively
)

# Example 3: Combine group selection with specific IDs and sort by ID
color_pick <- create_color_pick(
  color_id = c(4, 8, 12),
  groups = c(35, 27),
  subgroups = list(-1, c(1, 3)),  # -1 = reverse subgroup order (4:1)
  order_rule = 0  # Sort by color ID ascending
)
}
