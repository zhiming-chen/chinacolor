\title{Visualize 384 Chinese Traditional Colors in a Grid}
\usage{
plot_color_grid(show_group = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{show_group}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, adds visual indicators for color groups,
including bounding boxes for each group of four colors, a quadrant circle
with the group number, and a guiding legend. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object displaying the color grid with overlaid color IDs.
}
\description{
This function plots all 384 Chinese traditional colors, which are curated from
\emph{The Aesthetics of Colors in the Forbidden City}—a collection of hues embodying
centuries of Chinese cultural heritage. These colors are deeply rooted in
traditional rituals, nature observations, and artistic traditions, with many
associated with seasonal changes, festivals, and imperial aesthetics.
The colors are arranged in a 24x16 grid where each row corresponds to one of
the 24 solar terms, with 16 colors per term. This layout preserves the
cultural and seasonal significance of the original color organization.
}
\details{
The 384 colors are historically linked to China's 24 solar terms (\emph{jieqi}),
which mark seasonal transitions in the agricultural calendar. The 24 rows
directly correspond to these terms, and the 16 columns per row represent
4 color groups (each with 4 variants) selected to reflect the essence of
that term—creating a visual representation of the annual cycle.

When \code{show_group} is \code{TRUE}, the grid highlights groups of four colors
(representing the original \code{group_id} and \code{subgroup_id} structure) by drawing
bounding boxes around them and adding a numerical label within a quadrant
shape in the left of each group's bounding box.

# Plot with cultural/seasonal order (default behavior)

# Plot with group indicators and legend

\code{\link{list_colors}}: Displays 384 traditional Chinese colors in an interactive 16-column table (4 subgroups × 4 columns each),
where each subgroup includes color ID, visual preview, HEX code, and traditional name. Supports pagination
for easy browsing in RStudio Viewer.
